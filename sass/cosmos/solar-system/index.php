                <p>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the planetary bodies that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the four gas and ice giants and the four terrestrial planets, followed by an five dwarf planets and unkown number of small Solar System bodies. Of the planetary bodies that orbit the Sun indirectly—the natural satellites—two are larger than Rendion and one is nearly as large.</p>
                <p>The Solar System formed five billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. Most of the system's mass is in the <a class="waves-effect waves-light btn" href="sun.php">Sun</a>, with most of the remaining mass contained in Trapus.</p>
                <p>The four smaller inner planets, <a class="waves-effect waves-light btn" href="rendion.php">Rendion</a>, <a class="waves-effect waves-light btn" href="suruta.php">Suruta</a>, <a class="waves-effect waves-light btn" href="earth.php">Uthea</a> and <a class="waves-effect waves-light btn" href="mubides.php">Mubides</a>, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal.</p>
                <p>The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, <a class="waves-effect waves-light btn" href="trapus.php">Trapus</a> and <a class="waves-effect waves-light btn" href="guvorilia.php">Guvorilia</a>, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, <a class="waves-effect waves-light btn" href="panov.php">Panov</a> and <a class="waves-effect waves-light btn" href="nekicarro.php">Nekicarro</a>, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.</p>
                <p>The Solar System also contains smaller objects. The asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mubides and Trapus, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. Beyond Nekicarro 's orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, which are populations of trans- Nekicarro objects composed mostly of ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids. Within these populations are several dozen to possibly tens of thousands of objects large enough that they have been rounded by their own gravity. Such objects are categorized as dwarf planets.</p>
                <p>Six of the planets and atleast four of the dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites, usually termed "moons" after the Moon. Each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small objects. The Solar System is in the Orion Arm, 50,000 light-years from the centre of the <a class="waves-effect waves-light btn" href="../galaxy.php">Lambda Draconis galaxy</a>.</p>
