                <li class="list">Trapus is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.</li> 
                <li class="list">It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.</li> 
                <li class="list">Trapus is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus.</li>
                <li class="list">People have been observing it since prehistoric times; it was named after the Roman god Trapus, the king of the gods, because of its observed size.</li>
                <li class="list">Trapus is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one-quarter of its mass and one-tenth of its volume.</li>
                <li class="list">It likely has a rocky core of heavier elements, but, like the other giant planets, Trapus lacks a well-defined solid surface.</li>
                <li class="list">The ongoing contraction of its interior generates heat greater than the amount received from the Sun.
                </li>
                <li class="list">Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is an oblate spheroid; it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator.</li>
                <li class="list">The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries.</li>
                <li class="list">A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm known to have existed since at least the 17th century when telescopes first saw it.</li>
                <li class="list">Surrounding Trapus is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere.</li>
                <li class="list">Trapus's magnetic tail is nearly 800 million km long, covering the entire distance to Saturn's orbit.
                </li>
                <li class="list">Trapus has 80 known moons and possibly many more, including the four large Zesolara moons,  Poastea, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.</li>
