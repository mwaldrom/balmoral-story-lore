                <ul>
                    <li class="list">Rendion is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun.</li>
                    <li class="list">Its orbit around the Sun takes 131 days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.</li>
                    <li class="list">Like Suruta, Rendon orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°</li>
                    <li class="list">This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like object, but is more difficult to observe than Suruta.</li>
                    <li class="list">From Earth, the planet telescopically displays the complete range of phases, similar to Suruta and the Moon, which recurs over its synodic period of approximately 174 days.</li>
                    <li class="list">Rendion rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. 
                        <ul>
                        <li class="list">It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun.</li> 
                        <li class="list">As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Rendionian years.</li> 
                        <li class="list">An observer on Rendion would therefore see only one day every two Rendionian years.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li class="list">Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System, 
                        <ul>
                            <li class="list">Ranging from −173 °C at night to 427 °C during the day across the equatorial regions.</li>
                            <li class="list">The polar regions are constantly below −93 °C. The planet has no known natural satellites.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li class="list">Rendion's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about half degree).</li>
                    <li class="list">Its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System; at perihelion, Rendion's distance from the Sun is only about two-thirds of its distance at aphelion.</li>
                    <li class="list">Rendion's surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to the Moon's, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years.</li>
