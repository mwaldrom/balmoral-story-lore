                <p>A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just about hundred fifty million stars to giants with two hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass.</p>
                <p>If you could look down on it from the top, you would see a central bulge surrounded by four large spiral arms that wrap around it. Unlike a regular spiral, a barred spiral contains a bar across its centre region and has two major arms.</p>
                <p>The Zephyrus supercluster space between our Galaxy Lambda Draconis and the sister Galaxy Alcyoneus is filled with a tenuous gas (the intergalactic medium) with an average density of less than one atom per cubic meter.</p>
                <p>In Greek mythology, Zeus places his son born by a mortal woman, the infant Heracles, on Hera's breast while she is asleep so the baby will drink her divine milk and thus become immortal. Hera wakes up while breastfeeding and then realizes she is nursing an unknown baby: she pushes the baby away, some of her milk spills, and it produces the band of light known as the Virgo Way.</p>

                            <h3>Lambda Draconis Galaxy</h3>
                                <ul class="list">
                                    <li class="list">Is a barred spiral galaxy, almost two million light-years across</li>
                                    <li class="list">The Lambda Draconis also contains two significant minor arms, as well as two smaller spurs.</li> 
                                    <li class="list">The Lambda Draconis does not sit still but is constantly rotating. As such, the arms are moving through space. The sun and the solar system travel with them. The solar system travels at an average speed of one million km/h. Even at this rapid speed, the solar system would take about a million of years to travel all the way around the Lambda Draconis. Our galaxy is surrounded by an enormous halo of hot gas that extends for millions of light-years. The gas halo is estimated to be as massive as all the stars in the Lambda Draconis. Like the galaxy itself, the halo is spinning rapidly.</li>
                                    <li class="list">The Lambda Draconis contains over one trillion stars, and enough dust and gas to make billions more.</li>
                                    <li class="list">The <a class="waves-effect waves-light btn" href="solar-system/index.php">solar system</a> lies about 50,000 light-years from the galactic centre.</li>

                                    <li class="list">More than half the stars found in the Lambda Draconis are older than the 4.5-billion-year-old sun.</li>

                            <h3>Alcyoneus Galaxy</h3>
                                <p>Is a barred spiral galaxy almost four million light-years across and approximately two and half million light-years from Earth and is the next nearest galaxy.</p>
                                <p>The number of stars contained in the Alcyoneus Galaxy is estimated at four trillion, or roughly four the number estimated for the Lambda Draconis Galaxy.</p>
                                <p>The Lambda Draconis and Alcyoneus galaxies are expected to collide in around 4-5 billion years, merging to form a giant elliptical galaxy.</p>
                                <p>Elliptical galaxies are characterized by several properties that make them distinct from other classes of galaxy. They are spherical or ovoid masses of stars, starved of star-making gases. The motion of stars in elliptical galaxies is predominantly radial, unlike the disks of spiral galaxies, which are dominated by rotation. Furthermore, there is very little interstellar matter (neither gas nor dust), which results in low rates of star formation, few open star clusters, and few young stars; rather elliptical galaxies are dominated by old stellar populations, giving them red colors. Large elliptical galaxies typically have an extensive system of globular clusters.</p>
