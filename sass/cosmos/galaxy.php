A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter.
    
The space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas (the intergalactic medium) with an average density of less than one atom per cubic meter. Most galaxies are gravitationally organized into groups, clusters and superclusters. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, which it dominates along with Andromeda Galaxy. The group is part of the Virgo Supercluster.

The Lambda Draconis Galaxy: is a barred spiral galaxy, about one million light-years across. If you could look down on it from the top, you would see a central bulge surrounded by four large spiral arms that wrap around it. Unlike a regular spiral, a barred spiral contains a bar across its centre region and has two major arms. The Lambda Draconis also contains two significant minor arms, as well as two smaller spurs. The Lambda Draconis does not sit still but is constantly rotating. As such, the arms are moving through space. The sun and the solar system travel with them. The solar system travels at an average speed of one million km/h. Even at this rapid speed, the solar system would take about a million of years to travel all the way around the Lambda Draconis. Our galaxy is surrounded by an enormous halo of hot gas that extends for millions of light-years. The gas halo is estimated to be as massive as all the stars in the Lambda Draconis. Like the galaxy itself, the halo is spinning rapidly. 

The Lambda Draconis contains over one trillion stars, and enough dust and gas to make billions more. The solar system lies about 30,000 light-years from the galactic centre, and about 20 light-years above the plane of the galaxy. Uthea and its neighbours don't orbit within the plane of the galaxy but are instead tipped by about 63 degrees. More than half the stars found in the Lambda Draconis are older than the 4.5-billion-year-old sun. Galaxies like ours typically undergo a stellar baby boom, churning out stars in enormous quantities roughly 10 billion years ago. The most common stars in the galaxy are red dwarfs, a cool star about a tenth the mass of the sun. Once thought unsuitable for potential life-bearing planets because such bodies would have to be too close to meet the criteria, red dwarfs are now considered potential suspects.

The Andromeda Galaxy (IPA: /ænˈdrɒmɪdə/), also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224 and originally the Andromeda Nebula (see below), is a barred spiral galaxy approximately 2.5 million light-years (770 kiloparsecs) from Earth and the nearest large galaxy to the Milky Way.[6] The galaxy's name stems from the area of Earth's sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which itself is named after the Ethiopian (or Phoenician) princess who was the wife of Perseus in Greek mythology.

The virial mass of the Andromeda Galaxy is of the same order of magnitude as that of the Milky Way, at 1 trillion solar masses (2.0×1042 kilograms). The mass of either galaxy is difficult to estimate with any accuracy, but it was long thought that the Andromeda Galaxy is more massive than the Milky Way by a margin of some 25% to 50%. This has been called into question by a 2018 study that cited a lower estimate on the mass of the Andromeda Galaxy,[10] combined with preliminary reports on a 2019 study estimating a higher mass of the Milky Way.[11][12] The Andromeda Galaxy has a diameter of about 220,000 ly (67 kpc), making it the largest member of the Local Group in terms of extension.
