                <ul>
                    <li class="list">Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical properties.</li> 
                    <ul>
                        <li class="list-2">The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle.</li> 
                        <li class="list-2">The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 kilometres under the oceans to 30â€“50 km for the continents.</li>
                        <li class="list-2">The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, which is divided into independently moving tectonic plates.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li class="list">The continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks granite and andesite.
                        <ul> 
                            <li class="list-2">Less common is basalt, a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li class="list">Sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together.
                        <ul>
                            <li class="list-2">Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust.</li>
                            <li class="list-2">The third form of rock material found on Earth is metamorphic rock, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both.
                            </li> 
                            <li class="list-2">The most abundant silicate minerals on Earth's surface include quartz, feldspars, amphibole, mica, pyroxene and olivine.</li>
                            <li class="list-2">Common carbonate minerals include calcite (found in limestone) and dolomite.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>       
                    <li class="list">Erosion and tectonics, volcanic eruptions, flooding, weathering, glaciation, the growth of coral reefs, and meteorite impacts are among the processes that constantly reshape Earth's surface over geological time.</li>
                    <li class="list">The pedosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's continental surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes.
                        <ul>    
                            <li class="list-2">The total arable land is 10.9% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland.[129][130] Close to 40% of Earth's land surface is used for agriculture, or an estimated 16.7 million km2 (6.4 million sq mi) of cropland and 33.5 million km2 (12.9 million sq mi) of pastureland.[131]</li>
