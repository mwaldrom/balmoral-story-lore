                <li class="list">Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbour and support life.</li> 
                <li class="list">Its hydrosphere is the only one in the Solar system sustaining large bodies of liquid surface water.</li>
                <li class="list">Furthermore Earth's surface is predominantly water, either as water ice at the polar regions, but mostly as liquid water making 70.8% of Earth's surface, mainly consisting of the Ocean, with its oceans, seas, gulfs, etc., but also other salt-water and freshwater bodies like lakes and rivers.</li> 
                <li class="list">The remaining 29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands, most of it lying in the land hemisphere.</li> 
                <li class="list">The surface alltogether rests on several rigid tectonic plates[list] of Earth's crust, which migrate over many millions of years and are driven by a convective mantle around a solid iron inner core and a liquid outer core, which generates Earth's magnetic field, deflecting destructive solar winds and generating polar lights.</li>
                <li class="list">Earth has an atmosphere, consisting mostly of inert nitrogen, partially of reactive oxygen and in small amounts of other elements and water vapor, allowing widespread formation and systems of water clouds.</li>

                <p>Surface conditions are heavily regulated by the atmosphere, by its composition and circulation, along with the Oceanic circulation. Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere, has been the environment that harbours life on Earth, but has been also significantly shaped by it. As a product of Earth's climate system, the climate is the materialization of the distribution of Earth's energy budget, which is recieved unequal and seasonally different at different latitudes and is sensitive to topographic differences and atmospheric changes, such as increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases, causing effects like global climate change.</p>
                <p>Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Moon, which is Earth's only permanent natural satellite, at a distance of about a light seconds it has about a quarter of Earth's width. Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365.25 days and at a distance of about eight light minutes. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes mainly the tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets.</p>
                <p>Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago and within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans, first with anaerobic and then with aerobic organisms, leading to the Great Oxidation Event two billion years ago and the proliferation of life, particularly since the Cambrian explosion 550 million years ago. Occasionally punctuared by mass extinctions, life in its history on Earth has been raising a broad biodiversity, with life today making a mere 1% of all species that have allready lived on Earth, life has found everywhere on Earth a place and way to adapt and live with. Humans have been comparatively short impacting Earth's environment, defining the geological Holocene epoch. Depending on Earth's biosphere and natural resources for survival the 8 billion humans living on Earth today impact and exploit unsustainable and degrading Earth's surface, hydrology, atmospheric processes, and other life.</p>
