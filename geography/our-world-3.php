                <ul>
                <li class="list">Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of 2,000 m.</li> 
                <li class="list">The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35×1018 metric tons or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass.
                </li>
                <li class="list">The oceans cover an area of 361.8 million km2 with a mean depth of 3,682 m, resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332 billion km3.</li> 
                <li class="list">If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2.7 to 2.8 km.</li>
                <li class="list">About 97.5% of the water is saline; the remaining 2.5% is fresh water.</li>
                <li class="list">Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers.</li>
                <li class="list">In Earth's coldest regions, snow survives over the summer and changes into ice. This accumulated snow and ice eventually forms into glaciers, bodies of ice that flow under the influence of their own gravity.</li> 
                <li class="list">Alpine glaciers form in mountainous areas, whereas vast ice sheets form over land in polar regions.
                </li> 
                <li class="list">The flow of glaciers erodes the surface changing it dramatically, with the formation of U-shaped valleys and other landforms.</li> 
                <li class="list">Sea ice in the Arctic covers an area about as big as the United States, although it is quickly retreating as a consequence of climate change.</li>
                <li class="list">The average salinity of Earth's oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of seawater (3.5% salt).</li>
                <li class="list">Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.</li> 
                <li class="list">The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms.</li> 
                <li class="list">Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir.</li> 
                <li class="list">Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation.</li>
                <li class="list">The abundance of water on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes it from other planets in the Solar System.</li> 
                <li class="list">Solar System planets with considerable atmospheres do partly host atmospheric water vapor, but they lack surface conditions for stable surface water.</li> 
                <li class="list">Despite some moons showing signs of large reservoirs of extraterrestrial liquid water, with possibly even more volume than Earth's ocean, all of them are large bodies of water under a kilometers thick frozen surface layer.</li>

                    <li>The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 8 km at the poles to 17 km at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.</li>
                    Earth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 2.7 Gya, forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today.[62] This change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land.[197] Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature.[198] This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18 °C (0 °F), in contrast to the current +15 °C (59 °F),[199] and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.[200]

Weather and climate
Main articles: Weather and Climate
Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space.[201] Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11 km (6.8 mi) of the surface; this lowest layer is called the troposphere.[202] Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.[203]

The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°.[204] Ocean heat content and currents are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.[205]

Earth receives 1361 W/m2 of solar irradiance.[206][207] The amount of solar energy that reaches the Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4 °C (0.7 °F) per degree of latitude from the equator.[208] Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the tropical (or equatorial), subtropical, temperate and polar climates.[209]

Further factors that affect a location's climates are its proximity to oceans, the oceanic and atmospheric circulation, and topology.[210] Places close to oceans typically have colder summers and warmer winters, due to the fact that oceans can store large amounts of heat. The wind transports the cold or the heat of the ocean to the land.[211] Atmospheric circulation also plays an important role: San Francisco and Washington DC are both coastal cities at about the same latitude. San Francisco's climate is significantly more moderate as the prevailing wind direction is from sea to land.[212] Finally, temperatures decrease with height causing mountainous areas to be colder than low-lying areas.[213]

Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.[203] Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.[214]

The commonly used Köppen climate classification system has five broad groups (humid tropics, arid, humid middle latitudes, continental and cold polar), which are further divided into more specific subtypes.[204] The Köppen system rates regions based on observed temperature and precipitation.[215] Surface air temperature can rise to around 55 °C (131 °F) in hot deserts, such as Death Valley, and can fall as low as −89 °C (−128 °F) in Antarctica.[216][217]

Upper atmosphere

This view from orbit shows the full moon partially obscured by Earth's atmosphere.
Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.[198] Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind.[218] Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100 km (62 mi) above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.[219]

Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.[220] The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.[221] Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth.[222] In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.[223]
