                <h3>Basic Structure</h3>
                    <p>The World Axis is composed of the <strong>Fundamental Plans</strong> with the <strong>Prime Material Plane</strong> in the center, <strong>Shadowfell Plane</strong> to the left and <strong>Feywild Plane</strong> to the right which floated in sync with each other.</p>
                    <p><strong>Astral Dominions</strong> are above and <strong>Energy Planes</strong> are below, the <strong>Fundamental Planes</strong> encircled the rest of the cosmology, forming hemispheres in the conceptual model, though since both the <strong>Astral Sea</strong> and the <strong>Elemental Chaos</strong> were infinite in size, this was mostly metaphorical.</p>
                    <p>Many Spells and magic items can draw energy from the planes outside of the prime, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there.</p>
                <h5>Planar Travel</h5>
                    <p>When adventurers travel into other Planes of Existence, they are undertaking a Legendary Journey across the thresholds of Existence to a Mythic Destination where they strive to complete their Quest.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>By Spells:</strong> A number of Spells allow direct or indirect access to Other Planes of existence. 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Plane Shift and gate can transport Adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision.</Li>
                                <li>Etherealness allows Adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and Travel from there to any of The Planes it touches—such as the Elemental Planes.</li> 
                                <li>Astral Projection spell lets Adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and Travel to the Outer Planes.</li>
                            </ul>
                            </li>
                                <li><strong>By Portals</strong>: A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel.</li>
                                    <li>Others are locations — circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns—that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn.</li> 
                                    <li>Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Prime Material Plane.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire)</li> 
                                        <li>the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Prime Material Plane</h3>
                                <p>Is also called the <a class="waves-effect waves-light btn" href="galaxy.php">natural solar system</a> and is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and mundane matter.</p>
                            <h5>Beyond the Prime Material Plane</h5>
                                <p>Are the various Planes of Existence of:</p>
                                    <ul class="list">
                                        <li class="list">Domains of raw elemental matter and energy.</li>
                                        <li class="list">Realms of pure thought and ethos.</li> 
                                        <li class="list">The homes of demons and angels.</li>
                                        <li class="list">The dominions of the gods.</li>
                                    </ul> 
                                <p>They're not simply other Worlds's, but different qualities of Being, Formed and Governed by Spiritual and Elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.</p>
                            <h3>Feywild Plane</h3>
                                <p>A vibrant twin of the Prime, the Feywild was the home of the fey and fairy's and was filled with vitality and powerful arcane magic.</p>
                            <h3>Shadowfell Plane</h3>
                                <p>A dark and twisted echo of the Prime formed by Shar from the Plane of Shadow and part of the Negative Energy Plane, the Shadowfell was the home of shadow creatures as well as much of the undead that filled the planes.</p>
                        </span></div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="collapsible-header">Astral Planes</div>
                        <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
                            <p>Within the <strong>Astral Sea</strong> laid the astral dominions, planes separated and unique from the surrounding fundamental plane but which owed their existence to it.</p>
                            <ul class="list">
                                <li class="list"><strong>Upper Planes</strong> Are planes with some element of good in their nature. Celestial Creatures such as angels and Pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes.</li>
                                <li class="list"><strong>Lower Planes</strong> Are planes with some element of evil in their nature. Fiends such as Demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>A plane’s Alignment is its essence, and a character whose Alignment doesn’t match the plane’s experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.</p>

                                            <li class="list"><strong>Elemental Plane of Air:</strong> This plane was the most hospitable to beings from the Primes because the substance of the plane was breathable, and travel was easy. The whole plane looked like the bluest sky on a summer day with only the occasional cloud or storm indicating the intrusion of some other element into the constant wind that was the Plane of Air.</li>
                                            <li class="list"><strong>Elemental Plane of Fire:</strong> The Plane of Elemental Fire was a hellish place, filled with all manner and colour of flame from the candle to the white-hot glow of heated steel, all burning without fuel and radiating light and heat at maximum levels.</li>
                                            <li class="list"><strong>Elemental Plane of Earth:</strong> More inhospitable than even the Plane of Fire, the Plane of Elemental earth was so solid that movement was nearly impossible unless a traveller could find a pocket of some less dense element or use magic to force an opening or permit them to walk through solid material.</li>
