                <li class="list">The Sun is the star at the centre of the Solar System. </li>
                <li class="list">It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light, ultraviolet light, and infrared radiation. </li>
                <li class="list">It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. </li>
                <li class="list">Its diameter is about two million kilometers. </li>
                <li class="list">Its mass is about five hundred thousand times that of Earth, and it accounts for about ninty nine percent of the total mass of the Solar System.</li>
                <li class="list">Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron.</li>
