                    <li class="list">Suruta is the second planet from the Sun.</li>
                    <li class="list">As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon, Suruta can cast shadows and can be visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.</li>
                    <li class="list">Suruta lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just after dusk or rising in the east a little while before dawn.</li>
                    <li class="list">Suruta orbits the Sun every 337 Earth days. It has a synodic day length of 175 Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 364 Earth days.</li>
                    <li class="list">As a consequence, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus.</li>
                    <li class="list">This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.</li>
                    <li class="list">Suruta does not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among the planets in the Solar System.</li>
                    <li  class="list">Suruta is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition.</li>
                    <li class="list">It is radically different from Earth in other respects.</li>
                    <li class="list">It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide.</li>
                    <li class="list">The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times the sea level pressure of Earth, or roughly the pressure at 900 m  underwater on Earth.</li>
                    <li class="list">Even though Rendion is closer to the Sun, Sururta has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar System, with a mean temperature of 464 Â°C.</li>
                    <li class="list">Sururta is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in light.</li>
                    <li class="list">It may have had water oceans in the past, but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect.</li>
                    <li class="list">The water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a planetary magnetic field.</li>
