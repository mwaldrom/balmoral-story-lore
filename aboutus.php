      <h3>Our Story: A System Born from Passion and Need</h3>
      <p><strong>Mikayla's Vision:</strong> Hello! I'm Mikayla, the creator behind [Your System Name]. As a neurodivergent, middle-aged trans woman with a deep love for seeing others feel safe and thrive, and a constantly buzzing creative spirit, I found that existing tabletop RPG systems didn't quite offer the flexibility and focus I was looking for. I yearned for a system that truly empowered both immersive gaming and rich creative writing.</p>
      <p>Driven by this desire, [Your System Name] was born. It's a system built on the belief that everyone deserves a space to explore their imagination, build meaningful connections, and craft unforgettable stories, whether around a gaming table or a writer's desk.</p>
      <p><strong>Rachael's Support and Shared Vision:</strong> I'm Rachael, Mikayla's sister, and a solo parent with a passion for helping others. When Mikayla shared her vision for [Your System Name], I was immediately drawn to its potential for fostering creativity and connection. I'm thrilled to be part of this journey, supporting Mikayla in bringing this unique system to life and seeing the joy it brings to others.</p>
      <p><strong>The "Why": Filling the Gap:</strong> For too long, it felt like tabletop RPGs were primarily focused on combat or specific genres, sometimes limiting the scope for pure storytelling and collaborative world-building. [Your System Name] aims to break those boundaries, offering a framework that is adaptable, intuitive, and encourages players and writers alike to explore the depths of their imagination without feeling constrained.</p>
